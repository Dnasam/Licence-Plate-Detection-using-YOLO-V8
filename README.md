# Licence-Plate-Detection-using-YOLO-V8

Yolo is an algorithm that can recognize and locate objects in both still images and moving films. It achieves this by examining the photos' content. Yolo is an alternative to traditional object detection algorithms, which usually work by applying the same procedure to a picture in a loop. Following gridding of the image, different bounding boxes and class probabilities are projected for each grid cell separately. Yolo's ability to recognize things in real time is enabled by the fact that it just requires one pass over an image.
